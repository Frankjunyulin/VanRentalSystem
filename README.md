# VanRentalSystem
This is a prototype system that could serve as the "back-end" of a campervan rental system. Customers can make, change and delete campervan bookings. Campervans can be either Manual or Automatic. A vehicle must be picked up and dropped off at the same depot. Each booking has an ID number and is for one or more campervans (manual and/or automatic) for a period of time given by a start date and an end date (assume 2017 is the year for all dates, and dates are in the format HH MMM DD). A booking request is either granted in full or is completely rejected by the system; there are no bookings partially filled.
